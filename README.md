# EDC - Game Development in Unity

This is a hands-on workshop where we explore Unity as a tool and develop a simple **3D platformer local-multiplayer game** from empty project to deployed .exe file.

## Projects

The "Final Project" in the 2022 folder contains the target game for last year.  
The EDC 2023 contains the WIP / target game for 2023.

## Preparation (Before the workshop begins)

- I strongly recommend having a **mouse** (not mousepad)
- Those that have a gamepad ðŸŽ® (wireless or otherwise), please bring it if you can, we need as many as possible.
- I recommend a windows machine beacuse that is what i will be using, but Unity also works on MacOS and Linux.
- I recommend Visual Studio (Community/Entreprise/Professional) as the IDE as this works well with Unity debugging and C# programming, but any code editor will do the trick.
- For VS Code users:
  - Install the C# extension from the VS Code Marketplace: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp
  - Documentation: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity

### Pre-install process

- Create a **Unity User** - Use your Equinor e-mail
- Install the latest version of **Unity Hub** for your OS from [here](https://unity.com/download)
- **After installing Unity Hub**: Install **Unity Editor** [v2021.3.29f](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.29) (click **Install this version with Unity Hub.**).
- We will activate trial licenses for each participant the first day of the workshop
